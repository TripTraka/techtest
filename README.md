# Technical Test Instructions for .NET Developer Role

## Overview
This technical test evaluates your skills in development using C# with ASP.NET 8. The test consists of two tasks, each focusing on one of these areas. Your solutions will be assessed based on:

- Functionality: Does the application meet the specified requirements?
- Code quality: Is the code readable and well-structured?

As the time is limited we do not expect a perfect solution.  Do the best you can in the time allocated and see how far you can get.  If you finish the tasks quickly you can expand the solution by adding the ability to search on additional fields and/or unit tests.
